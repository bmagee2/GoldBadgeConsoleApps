# Hey! Look at these Console Apps for Gold Badge

## To complete Gold Badge, I created 3 console apps for the Komodo Company(not a real company). Each was created using repository design patterns and unit tests. Check out the code and try them out!

## Challenge 1

### Komodo Cafe

Komodo cafe is getting a new menu. The manager wants to be able to create new menu items, update menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu. She needs a console app.
